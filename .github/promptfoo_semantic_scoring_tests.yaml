# Description:

# This Promptfoo configuration defines sanity-check style evaluations for Zephyr-7B and Mistral-7B models
# using Hugging Face inference endpoints. It validates whether model responses are semantically accurate,
# on-topic, and structurally appropriate using `embeddingSimilarity` metrics. These lightweight tests help
# detect regressions or hallucinations when updating prompts or switching models. Useful for knowledge-base bots,
# marketing content generation, or FAQ assistants expected to return structured Markdown output.
